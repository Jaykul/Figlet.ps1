# Figlet

[FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/) is a program for making large letters out of ordinary text.

This PowerShell module is a set of commands for PowerShell, based on @auriou's [FIGlet.Net library](/auriou/FIGlet), and my [Pansies](/PoshCode/Pansies) module for doing colors in PowerShell using ANSI escape sequences.
